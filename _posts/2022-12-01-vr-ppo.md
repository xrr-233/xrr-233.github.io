## Introduction

This project is made for *PIA2307 Introduction to Public Governance‚ City University of Hong Kong*․

"PPO" means "Public Policy". This project is a virtual immersive learning scene for teaching activities in public administrative courses developed using Unity incorporated with VRChat SDK. The world of VRChat-PPO is public, which means not only PPO students, but also anyone who is interested in PPO (or just for fun) can enter the world using VRChat to learn about some public administrative concepts by interaction between the scene during the visit. It provides with a new way to teach and learn through virtual scene, which may broaden students' interest as well as their insight on the concepts, understanding their functions that keep the real world running.
