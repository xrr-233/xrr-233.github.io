This project is the race record of Global Game Jam 2021 Hong Kong, completed in collaboration with several members (team leader: Mr. Mao Yuxuan).

You are a bird, Poo Poo, who got lost and could not contact your friends due to the destruction of your original home. In this unfamiliar environment, you should come over all kinds of difficulties, discover the mystery, and find your friends. In this platform jump game, the player would easily lose in the scene if he played the game normally. You need to find some unique ways to overcome obstacles and solve the puzzle.
