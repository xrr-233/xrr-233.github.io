I am currently a Master of Science student studying Computer Science (Multimedia & Creative Technologies) at University of Southern California. I am interested in and looking forward to develop and collaborate on CG-related topics, like 3D reconstruction, digital human (with computer vision), etc.

**Note:** I only accept email contact, so please contact me by the email provided in [my profile](contact.md) instead.
