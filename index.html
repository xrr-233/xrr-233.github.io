    <h2>About</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I am a Master student studying Computer Science (Multimedia & Creative Technologies) at University of Southern California. I am currently working as a student researcher at the Institute of Creative Technologies. Prior to my Master's studies, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from City University of Hong Kong with the First Class Honor title.</p>
    <p>My current research is focusing on the projects related to specific tasks of 3D reconstruction & neural rendering utilizing Gaussian Splatting techniques.</p>
    <p>I am also interested in and looking forward to developing and collaborating on other specific related topic about CG, such as Character & Digital Human, Physics Simulation, 3D Vision, Game Engines, Visual Effects, VR/AR, etc.</p>
    <p>Other related hobbies including Music & Video Making, Modeling, Rigging & Animation, Audio Processing, Voice Conversion & Text-to-speech, Image Processing, Gaming, etc.</p>
