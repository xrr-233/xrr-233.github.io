<p>I am currently a Master of Science student studying Computer Science (Multimedia & Creative Technologies) at University of Southern California. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from City University of Hong Kong with the First Class Honor title.</p>
<p>I am interested in and looking forward to developing and collaborating on specific related topic about CG, like 3D reconstruction, neural rendering, modeling, game engine, physics simulation, animation, visual effects, character & digital human, 3D vision, VR/AR, etc.</p>
<p>Other related hobbies including music & video making, mikumikudance, rigging, audio processing, voice conversion & text-to-speech, image processing, gaming, etc.</p>
