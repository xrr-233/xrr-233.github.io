<p>I am currently a Master of Science student studying Computer Science (Multimedia &amp; Creative Technologies) at University of Southern California. I am interested in and looking forward to develop and collaborate on CG-related topics, like 3D reconstruction, digital human (with computer vision), etc.</p>
